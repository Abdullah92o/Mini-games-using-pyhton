Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python.
How to Play

    Run the Python script tic_tac_toe.py.
    The game will display an empty 3x3 grid representing the Tic-Tac-Toe board.
    Players take turns entering their moves. Player 1 starts with 'X' and Player 2 follows with 'O'.
    To make a move, enter the corresponding number of the empty space on the grid.
    The game will check for a win condition after each move and declare the winner or a draw.
    If you want to play again, simply run the script again.

Rules

    The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
    Players take turns marking empty spaces with their respective symbols ('X' or 'O').
    The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
    If all spaces on the board are filled and no player has won, the game is declared a draw.
